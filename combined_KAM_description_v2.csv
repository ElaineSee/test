The impairment losses were made following the inability of the Group to harvest fresh fruit bunches from these estates. Following the reassessment, Group the has estimated that the net recoverable amounts are to be higher than the carrying amounts as at 31 December 2018 and thus, a reversal of impairment loss of RM329,528 and RM1,167,465 respectively on property, plant and equipment and bearer plants has been recognised as other non-operating income in the profit or loss. The impairment assessment of the property, plant and equipment and bearer plants is disclosed in Notes 3.2.1 and 4.2 to the financial statements. Our procedures focused on evaluating and assessing key assumptions used by management in carrying out the impairment review.

Refer to Notes 4, 6(e), 16(d)(i) and 21 to the financial statements. As at 31 Dr 2018, the carrying amount (net of impairment) of the Group's PPE which consist of oil palm estates and a palm oil mill in Liberia amounted to RM242.8 million and the carrying amount (net of impairment) of the Company's cost of investment in SDP Liberia amounted to RM242.8 million. We have assessed the objectivity, capability and competency of the external valuer appointed by the Group by considering the valuer's professional background, reputation, experience in similar industries and held discussions with the valuer. We confirmed that the external valuer is independent and neither affiliated nor a related party of the Group. The Group had injected additional funds into SDP Liberia as deemed equity for the purposes of supporting the Liberia operations as SDP Liberia did not meet its operating targets due to lower Crude Palm Oil (""CPO"") and Palm Kernel Oil prices and incurred higher operating cost which lead to higher losses as compared to the forecast. These were identified as indicators for an impairment test to be performed for the Group's PPE and the Company's cost of investment in relation to its Liberia operations. We have assessed the recoverable amount of the oil palm mill and oil palm estates (collectively known as ""plantation assets"") based on the fair value less costs to sell (FVLCTS). The key assumptions of the previous financial year was updated by management with external valuer's assistance to determine the FVLCTS of the plantation assets as at 31 December 2018. We evaluated the reasonableness of the key assumptions used in the cash flow projections by comparing CPO selling price, FFB yields and operating costs to historical results, forecasted commodity prices and industry data where appropriate. Management's assessment on the recoverable amounts of the Group's PPE and the Company's cost of investment in SDP Liberia was determined using the fair value less costs of disposal (""FVLCTS"") based on an income approach performed by external valuers, CBRE CH Williams Sdn Bhd. As at 31 December 2018, the key assumptions applied during the 30 June 2018 impairment assessment were re-evaluated and updated by management with the assistance of the external valuer and approved by the Directors. We involved our valuation experts to assess the discount rate used in determining the recoverable amounts of the Group's PPE and the Company's cost of investment in SDP Liberia. The valuation methodology, evaluated in the previous financial year by our valuation experts remains appropriate and had been used by the external valuers in determining the FVLCTS. We focused on the recoverability of the carrying amount of the Group's PPE and the Company's cost of investment in SDP Liberia due to the significant estimates involved in determining the key assumptions used in deriving the recoverable amounts principally CPO selling prices, Fresh Fruit Bunch (""FFB"") yields, operating costs and the discount rates. We assessed the appropriateness of sensitivity analysis performed by management, including the disclosures, on a reasonable possible change in the key assumptions and the corresponding effect on the respective recoverable amounts by observing the re-performance of the sensitivity analysis by the external valuer. Based on management's assessment, impairment losses of RM14.5 million and RM49.6 million were recorded on the Group's PPE in SDP Liberia and the Company's cost of investment in SDP Liberia as at 31 December 2018 respectively, as stated in Notes 16(d)(i) and 21 to the financial statements. Based on the above procedures, we did not note any material exception to management's impairment assessment on the Group's PPE in SDP Liberia and the Company's cost of investment in SDP Liberia as at 31 December 2018. pwc Financial Statements REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)",re refer not note an accounting policy notes financial disclosures is two subsidiaries up spb pelita suai sdn plantation plant at bhd sarawak agriculture development recognised impairment losses loss rm10 rm1 568 100 285 232 property equipment bearer be bear are plants prior or year years we were made following inability ability harvest fresh fruit bunch bunches ch from these estates reassessment as assessment assess has estimated that net recoverable amounts amount higher than carrying 31 december 2018 thus reversal rm329 528 16 167 465 respectively respective been other non operating income profit disclosed statements statement our procedures focused used use evaluating assessing key assumptions by management out review view included assessed determination cgu required under mfrs 136 assets ii evaluated evaluate below for forecast cast selling sell price yield cost costs administration discount rate comparing them historical results known market industry trends challenged all basis estimations applied whether there anymanagement any biasness iii considered adequacy about which outcome most sensitive audit auditors responsibilities continue continued part accordance with approved standards auditing malaysia international exercise professional judgement maintain scepticism throughout also identify if risks risk material misstatement company due fraud error design perform responsive those obtain evidence sufficient appropriate provide opinion detecting resulting one may involve collusion forgery intentional omissions misrepresentations represent presentation override internal control understanding relevant order circumstances but purpose expressing express effect effectiveness appropriateness policies reasonableness reasonable estimates related directors conclude going concern based obtained uncertainty exists events conditions significant doubt draw attention report such inadequate modify conclusions date however future cause cease overall structure content including underlying transactions manner gives true fair regarding information entities business activities within responsible direction supervision performance remain solely communicate among matters planned scope timing findings deficiencies during have complied ethical requirements independence relationships relation reasonably thought where applicable safeguards 21 ppe consist oil palm mill liberia amounted rm242 million investment sdp objectivity capability competency external valuer value appointed considering background reputation experience similar industries held discussions confirmed independent neither affiliated nor party had injected additional funds into deemed equity purposes supporting operations did meet its targets lower crude cpo kernel prices incurred lead compared identified indicators test performed collectively less fvlcts previous was updated assistance determine cash flow projections ffb yields forecasted commodity data determined using disposal approach valuers cbre williams 30 june involved valuation experts determining methodology remains recoverability deriving principally rates sensitivity analysis possible change corresponding observing rm14 rm49 recorded stated above exception pwc
1117,SIME DARBY PLANTATION BHD,2019,Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets,"Refer to Notes 4 and 24(i) to the financial statements. The intangible assets of the Group's consolidated financial statements include goodwill of RM2,147.6 million which arose from the acquisition of NBPOL group during the financial year ended 30 June 2015. The goodwill was partly allocated to PT Minamas Gemilang and its subsidiaries (""Minamas Group"") cash generating units (""CGUs"") as Minamas Group operations are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition of NBPOL. We evaluated the reasonableness of the key assumptions used by management in the approved cash flow projections by comparing the FFB yields and CPO selling prices to historical results, forecasted commodity prices and industry data where appropriate. We had also agreed the projection period to the lease terms for the respective CGUs. We assessed the reliability of management's cash flow projections by comparing their previous years' forecasted results against past trends of actual results. We checked that management has also updated the cash flow projections with the updated historical results. In accordance with the Group's policy, the Group determine whether goodwill is impaired on an annual basis. Management performed impairment assessments of the two CGUs based on value-in-use (""VIU"") determined using the discounted cash flow models, which was approved by the Directors. A range of sensitivity analysis was also performed by management. We involved our valuation experts to assess the discount rates used in determining the recoverable amounts of the respective CGUs. We focused on the recoverability of the carrying amount of goodwill in NBPOL due to the significant amount and significant estimates involved in determining the key assumptions used in deriving the recoverable amounts of the CGUs, i.e. projection period, FFB yields, CPO selling prices and the discount rates as disclosed in Note 24(i). We assessed the appropriateness of sensitivity analysis performed by management, including the disclosures of a reasonable possible change in the key assumptions and the corresponding effect on the respective recoverable amounts by re-performing the sensitivity analysis. Based on management's assessments, no impairment was required as the recoverable amounts exceeded the carrying amount of goodwill in NBPOL as at 31 December 2018. Based on the above procedures, we did not note any material exception to management's assessment on the recoverability of the Group's carrying amount of goodwill in NBPOL as at 31 December 2018.

The Group operates aircraft which are either owned or held under operating lease arrangement. In respect of the aircraft held under operating lease arrangements, the Group is contractually obligated to maintain the aircraft during the lease period and to redeliver the aircraft to the lessors at the end of the lease term, in certain pre-agreed conditions. Accordingly, the Group estimates the aircraft maintenance costs required to fulfil these obligations at the end of the lease period and recognise a provision for these costs at each reporting date. A provision by its nature is more uncertain than most other items in the statement of financial position. The estimates of the outcome and financial effects are determined by the judgement of the management, supplemented by experience from similar transactions. Due to the magnitude of the provision and the significant judgment involved in estimating the cost to be incurred and timing of cash outflows, we consider this to be an area of audit focus.

(ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½SATSï¿½ï¿½ï¿½). This transaction was completed on 14 February 2018 via both exchange of shares, and for cash. As a result, GTRH became a joint venture of the Group, requiring its retained interest to be measured at fair value, pursuant to MFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. The loss of control in GTRH, from 100% to 50%, has resulted in the following accounting impact at AAGB Group: (a) Gain on disposal of a subsidiary amounting to RM350.3 million; and (b) Remeasurement gain on retained interest in a former subsidiary of RM534.7 million.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2018, revenue from scheduled flights and ancillary services represents 83% (2017: 83%) of the total revenue of the Group and of the Company. The Group and the Company rely on an integrated information technology system (including the flight reservation system and revenue accounting system) in accounting for its scheduled flights and ancillary revenue. Such information system processes large volumes of data comprising individually low value transactions. The flight reservation system is managed by a third party vendor. Our audit sought to place a high level of reliance on the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s and the Companyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s information technology systems and key controls which the management relies on in recording revenue from scheduled flights and ancillary services. As the flight reservation system is managed by a third party vendor, we obtained and evaluated theditorsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ report on the operating effectiveness of the key controls over the flight reservation system and revenue accounting system.

The Group adopted MFRS 9 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Financial Instrumentsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ with a date of transition of 1 April 2018. MFRS 9 introduces an expected credit loss (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ECLï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) impairment model, which requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour. This is a new and complex accounting standard which has required considerable judgement and interpretation in its implementation. In particular, the significant judgements in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL include the following: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Building the appropriate models used to calculate ECL. The models are inherently complex and judgement is applied in determining the appropriate construct of the model; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Identification of loans, advances and financing that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk; and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assumptions used in the ows, forward-looking macroeconomic factors and data sets to be used as inputs to the models. We obtained an understanding and tested managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s controls over identification of loans, advances and financing that have experienced significant increase in credit risk or objective evidence of impairment in accordance with the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s policy and procedures, and the calculation of ECL provisions. We tested a sample of loans, advances and financing and assessed the reasonableness of managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s judgement that there was no significant increase in credit risk or objective evidence of impairment for these loans. Where objective evidence of impairment was identified by the Group and impairment loss was individually calculated, we examined both the quantum and timing of future cash flows used by the Group in the impairment loss calculation, challenged the assumptions and compared estimated to external evidence where available. Calculations of the discounted cash flows were also re-performed. To opriateness of models implemented by the Group, we have: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed the methodologies inherent within the ECL models applied against the requirements of MFRS 9; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Tested the design and operating effectiveness of the controls relating to: - Governance over ECL methodology, model development and model validation; - Data used to determine the allowances for credit losses; and - Calculation, review and approval of the ECL calculation. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed and tested the significant modelling assumptions; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed and considered reasonableness of forward-looking forecasts assumptions; and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Checked the accuracy of data and calculation of the ECL amount, on a sample basis.

Reviewing the approach used by management to derive the assumptions using our industry knowledge and experience; ii. Comparing them with the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s actual historical experience, market observable data (as applicable) and our views of current trends and experience to-date. We performed independent review of model points on sample basis to assess if the methodologies and assumptions reviewed have been consistently applied.

The estimation of claims liabilities is sensitive to various factors and uncertainties as discussed in Noremium Liabilities As at 31 December 2018, the Group has accounted for RM1,030 million of gross premium liabilities, based on the higher of Unexpired Risk Reserves (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½URRï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) of RM815 million and Unearned Premium Reserves (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½UPRï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) of RM1,030 million as required under the RBC Framework. We focused on this area as the estimation of URR involves significant judgement in identifying best estimate values of future contractual cash flows in consideration of the expected loss and expenses for policies in-force as at year-end at the required risk margin for adverse deviation. Our audit procedures included the following: We evaluated the design and tested key controls over reserving process, including controls over the completeness and accuracy of premium data, and settlement of claims that support key reserving calculations and controls over the valuation of claims and premium liabilities. We tested the underlying data used in estimation of general insurance contract liabilities to source r actuarial experts to assist us in reviewing and assessing the methodologies, basis and key assumptions used in the valuation of claims liabilities and premium liabilities in accordance with the requirements of the RBC Framework and liability adequacy test under MFRS 4 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Insurance Contractsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. We reviewed and assessed the reasonableness of key actuarial assumptions by referencing to the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s historical experiences, current trends and our own industry knowledge. Our actuarial experts performed independent re-projections of claims liabilities and unexpired risk reserves (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½URRï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) respectively for selected major classes of business, focusing on the largest and most uncertain claims reserves and URR. The re-projected claims liabilities and URR are compared to those recorded by management and evaluated if they are within range. We also assessed the appropriateness and adequacy of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s disclosures in relation to the general insurance contract liabilities in the historical claims development and sensitivity analysis of key assumptions used in the valuation of insurance contract liabilities. Based on the procedures performed, the methodology and key assumptions used by the Group in the valuation of general insurance contract liabilities as at 31 December 2018 are not inappropriate.

Arising from the business combination, the Group has recognised a significant amount of goodwill of RM76 million, predominantly allocated to the cash generating unit (""CGU"") that is expected to benefit from synergies of the business combination. The Group conducted an impairment assessment on the CGU to identify if the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, indicating that the goodwill may be impaired. The Group determined the recoverable amount of the CGU based on its value-in-use, using discounted cash flows projections in which the Directors made judgements over certain key inputs, including revenue growth rates, profit margin, discount rates and terminal value growth rates. How the matter was addressed in our audit: Our audit procedures performed in this area included, amongst others: We obtained the cash flows projections performed by the Group and considered whether there were material inconsistencies with the approved business plans and forecasts.

Idea had, on 12 February and 23 February 2018, allotted additional equity shares aggregating to INR 35.0 billion. Following the non-participation by the Group on Idea's issuance of new shares, the Group's equity interest in Idea decreased from 19.74% to 16.33%. The Group recognised a loss of dilution amounting to RM357.6 million during the financial year. We performed the following audit procedures: ï¿½ï¿½ We checked the date of issuance and number of shares issued by Idea via the announcement made to the National Stock Exchange of India and recomputed the Group's shareholding in Idea and the corresponding loss on dilution; We discussed with management the likelihood of the merger to be completed during the year and the appropriateness of using fair value less costs to sell to determine the recoverable amount of the Group's investment in Idea; ï¿½ï¿½ We checked the computation of the impairment performed by management; and .

On 16 August 2018, the Group had relinquished its rights to appoint an Axiata representative as a Board member and anti-dilution rights under the Subscription Agreement between Group and Idea and therefore ceased to have significant influence over Idea.

Recoverability of these assets is based on forecasting and discounting future cash flows, which are inherently judgmental. We focused on this area because of the significance of the costs capitalised and the fact that there is judgment involved in assessing whether the criteria, set out in MFRS 138 Intangible Assets, required for capitalisation of such costs have been met, including the likelihood of the project delivering sufficient future economic benefits. Where the costs incurred are internally generated, there is further judgment required in the calculation, such as the accuracy of amount of time spent on the projects. We also focused on whether there is objective evidence of the carrying value for development expenditures are impaired. We discussed with management on their assessment as to whether development projects in-progress were still expected to deliver sufficient positive economic benefits upon their completion. For completed development projects, we considered whether the useful economic lives remained appropriate for those assets. Our procedures included the following: - tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal controls related to the capitalisation of cost of developed intangible assets such as employee costs and development costs, according to respective projects; - tested the amounts capitalised during the reporting period are in accordance with the requirements of MFRS 138 Intangible Assets; - assessed the reliability of managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s forecast through the review of past trends of actual financial performance against previous forecasted results; - tested the discount rates assigned to the cash generating units, as well as the long-term growth rates, with reference to our understanding of the business, comparisons to other similar companies, economic and industry forecasts where appropriate.

Auditorï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditorsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taf these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the efff the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s and the Companyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s internal control. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Conclude on the appropriateness of the directorsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s or the Companyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditorsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditorsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to ceasrall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate wim all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

MFRS 9 introduces an expected credit loss (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ECLï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) impairment model, which requires the use of significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit risk of the customers. An opening balance adjustment of RM15.5 million was made for additional loss allowances as at 1 January 2018. Management has assessed the lifetime expected credit loss of trade receivables amount using the simplified approach incorporating credit rating buckets, expected loss rates, forward looking information and probability weighted estimprior to loss allowance was RM1.2 billion. Of this amount, RM404.9 million has been provided for as loss allowance.

In March 2016, Woodside, the charterer of a FPSO vessel ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Armada Claire terminated the services agreement (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½contractï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) with a subsidiary of the Group, Armada Balnaves Pte Ltd (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ABPLï¿½ï¿½ï¿½). The vessel was subsequently demobilised. The termination of contract was an indication of impairment to the carrying amount of the vessel, (which was impaired to its recoverable amount in 2016) and the recoverability of the amounts in relation to the contract, by ABPL. The Group, having evaluated its contractual position through independent due diligence review(s), has taken the view that the termination of the contract was unlawful and ABPL is therefore contractually entitled to compensation claims based on the contract. ABPL filed a Statement of Claim at the Supreme Court of Western Australia on 20 April 2016 against Woodside and the trial commenced on 18 February 2019. The parties served written closingubmissions on 26 and 27 March 2019 respectively and the Judgement is expected to be presented between October to December 2019. Management has assessed the lifetime ECL of the amount by taking into consideration the probability-weighted estimation of courtï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s judgement, timing of courtï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s judgement, quantum of compensation claims and timing of receipt of compensation claims. We gave audit focus to this area in view of financial implication and judgement involved surrounding the recoverability of the receivables on the basis that the termination of the contract was unlawful. The details of the significant estimates and judgement used by the management of the Group have been disclosed in Preface to the financial statements section D ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Critical accounting estimates and judgements. We held discussions with senior management personnel and experts with direct knowledge of the matter and read supporting documents provided to us by management to understand the latest status of proceedings and ABsed on the contract. We also discussed with management the likely timing of the recovery of these amounts based on the progress of the case and expected resolution date based on the latest court timelines. We found the information provided and the discussions with the parties described above to be materially consistent with managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s assessment of the recoverability of the amount.

As at 31 Decembe due from subsidiaries and investments in subsidiaries amounted to RM0.4 billion and RM4.5 billion respectively. Amounts due from subsidiaries An assessment on the recoverability of the amounts due from subsidiaries were made based on the general 3-stage ECL model requirement under MFRS 9 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Financial Instrumentsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. The ECL is made based on the contractual terms that the balances are repayable on demand as at the reporting date. No additional loss allowance were made during the financial year as management expects that the subsidiaries are able to meet their obligation to repay these balances based on the availability of cash flows as at the financial year end and/or that there are sufficient future cash flows from the subsidiaries to settle the outstanding balances. Amounts due from subsidiaries We evaluated the reasonableness of the key assumptions that affected the amounts and timing of cash flows available to the subsidiaries for repayments of the amounts due under the ECL model. These key ase contractual and estimated revenue, estimated utilisation and charter rates of vessels and expected sale of vessels. These key assumptions were checked against historical trends, contracts with customers and the expected fair value less costs of disposal of vessels. We held discussions with management to understand the underlying assumptions of the respective future cash flows used to determine the recoverable amounts of the amounts due from subsidiaries.

The impairment provisions for trade receivables are based on assumptions about risk of default and expected loss rate. The Group uses judgement in making these assumptions and selecting inputs to the impairment calculation, based on the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s and the Companyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s past history and forward-looking estimates at the end of each reporting period. The Group uses a provision matrix to calculate expected credit losses for trade receivables. The provision rates depend on the number of days that a trade receivable is past due. The Group uses the grouping according to the customer segments that have similar loss patterns. The provision matrix is initially based on the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s historical observed default rates. The Group will calibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are s in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

6780,MRCB-QUILL REIT,2019,Valuation of Investment,"MQREIT adopts the fair value model for its investment properties. The policy of MQREIT is that property valuations are performed by external experts at least once a year. The carrying value of the investment properties as at 31 December 2018 of RM2,158,708,055 represents 95% of total assets of MQREIT and therefore the valuation exercise was significant to our audit. The areas that involved significant audit effort and judgement were the assessment of the basis and assumptions used by the external experts to derive the fair value of the investment properties. The basis and assumptions include amongst others, estimated rental revenues, yield rates and discount rates which are based on current and future market or economic conditions. Our audit procedures included, amongst others, considering the objectivity, independence and expertise of the external appraisers. We furthermore assessed the appropriateness of the valuation methodology adopted, reviewed and assessed inputs related to the property for the valuations and considered the underlying assumptions against the market estimates. Further, we had discussions with the independent valuers to obtain an understanding of the property related data used as input to the valuation models which included, amongst others, rental income data and yield rate. We then tested the accuracy of rental income data applied in the valuation by comparing them with lease agreements and challenged the yield rate by comparing them with available industry data, taking into consideration comparability and market factors. For discount rate, we assessed whether the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows reflects the estimated market rate of return for comparable assets with similiar profile.

Verified the contract sums and material cost elements in the project budgets, for selected significant on-going projects, against their supporting documentation including contracts, key assumptions and workings for estimates of contract costs. We also considered the accuracy of management's past estimates and assessed the consistency of assumptions used across the selected projects. Performed inquiries with to management assess whether the status of on-going contracts accord with the stage of completion determined for revenue recognition and also whether the estimates used for project budgets are reasonable. We further assessed whether management has updated the project budgets where actual revenue or costs have deviated significantly from estimates. Performed recomputation to assess the mathematical accuracy of revenue and costs recognised based on stage of completion  and considered the implications of any identified error and change in estimates. Verified actual contract billings and costs recognised for selected projects to supporting invoices. . Evaluated the management's procedures for reviewing and monitoring of trade receivables and contract assets to determine their recoverability. As explained in Note 2.2(a), MFRS 9 Financial Instruments has introduced an expected credit loss (""ECL"") impairment model for financial assets and contract assets. The new ECL impairment model is a forward-looking approach which requires management's significant judgement on assumptions and estimates which have significant impact on the valuation of trade receivables and contract assets of the Group. For determining ECL at the reporting date, the Group uses a provision matrix based on the age of receivables and assumptions on credit risk profiling, expected loss rate, expected future cash flows and macro economic conditions. 3 Assessment of impairment on the carrying value of the Company's investment in subsidiaries and amounts due from subsidiaries ï¿½ï¿½ Compared the cash flow projections used to the approved budgets for the subsidiaries.

7863,ECM LIBRA FINANCIAL GROUP BHD,2019,"Impairment of investment in subsidiaries and associates,JV","The Group and the Company acquired several investments and business ventures during the year and these have been classified as investments in joint ventures as disclosed in Notes 11 and 34 to the financial statements. In relation to these new investments and business ventures, we focused on the following: (i) the identification of underlying intangible assets or bargain purchased options, if any, resulting from these acquisitions on the date of acquisitions. The identification of such intangible assets and bargain purchased options would be dependent on valuation of the underlying identifiable tangible assets and liabilities of the joint ventures acquired and is therefore judgmental in nature. Due to the subjective nature of the valuation, we consider this to be an area of audit focus; and (ii) potential impairment assessment of the joint ventures as at the reporting date. The losses reported by some of these joint ventures or the lack of an active principal activity during the year indicate that the carrying amount of the investments in these joint ventures may be impaired. Accordingly, the Group and the Company performed an impairment test on those investments which demonstrated an indication of impairment by estimating the recoverable amount of such investment using the value-in-use (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½VIUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) methodology. Estimating the VIU involves estimating the future cashflows that may be derived from these investments and discounting them at an appropriate rate. Such impairment reviews are judgmental in nature, in particular, the assumptions on the cashflows and growth rate, gross profit margin, terminal growth rate and discount rate. Accordingly, we identify this area as a matter requiring audit focus. The Group and the Companyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s impairment policy for joint ventures is disclosed in Note 2.4(ii) to the financial statements. In addressing these areas of audit focus: - We obtained an understanding of the methodology adopted by management in estimating the cash flows to be derived from these investments and assessed whether such methodology is consistent with those used in the industry; - We evaluated managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s assumptions on the key inputs used in the valuation methodology, including the future cashflows and growth rates estimated by these investments, market values of underlying properties held by these joint ventures, and the estimated margins of these joint ventures, on the acquisition date and as at the reporting date; and - We also assessed the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows that it reflects the rate of return that investors would expect from similar investments.

7892,ECOBUILT HOLDINGS BHD,2019,Revenue and cost recognition,"During the financial year, the Group recognised revenue from construction activities amounting to RM47.1million (2018: RM62.3million). The Group recognises construction revenue and related cost in profit or loss by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation using the output method. The output method recognises revenue based on contract work certified to date which depicts the basis of direct measurements of value to the customer for the work performed to date relative to the remaining construction work promised under the contract. We focused on this area because there is inherent subjectivity in the judgements and estimation uncertainty involved in the estimation of the progress towards complete satisfaction of performance obligations as well as the estimated total contract revenue and costs. We have reviewed the Group's controls on the project budget used to estimate the total construction project costs, revenue recognition and actual project costs incurred. On a test basis, we sighted to the certification of actual work performed by external architects. Based on physical proportion of work done certified, we reperformed the calculation of revenue recognised for the financial year. We have also checked the extent of actual costs incurred by agreeing a sample of costs incurred to the supporting documents. In addition, we have discussed with management/ project team on the status of the projects and compared the construction project's estimated costs to complete against the progress certified by external architects in order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated total construction project costs.

The foreseeable losses arising from total budgeted costs exceeding total contract revenue is recognised immediately in profit or loss. Consequently, any changes in the judgements and related estimates in arriving at total budgeted costs will result in a change in the foreseeable losses recognised. The accounting policies and relevant disclosures for revenue are set out in Note 3, Note 4, Note 5 and Note 33 to the Financial Statements.

The Group has determined that certain performance obligations in relation to property development activities are satisfied over time and thus recognises revenue from this activity over time. The amount of revenue and profit recognised from property development activities are dependent on, amongst others, the extent of costs incurred to the total estimated costs of construction to derive the percentage-of-completion; the actual number of units sold and the estimated total revenue for each of the respective projects.

10255,GLOMAC BHD,2019,Revenue and cost recognition,"Revenue from property development during the year as disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements amounted to RM228 million, which represented 84% of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s revenue. The Group recognises revenue from property development using the cost-based input method, which is measured on the basis of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s efforts or inputs to the property development costs incurred to date relative to the total expected property development costs. Property development projects and expense estimates are reviewed and revised periodically as work progresses and as variation orders are approved. In determining the total expected property development costs, significant management estimates and judgement is involved, which includes relying on the opinion or service of experts, past experience and continuous monitoring of the budgeting process. These management estimates and judgements affect the cost-based input method computations and the amount of revenue and profit recognised during the year, as well as assessverability of the property development projects. Our audit response We reviewed managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s assessment on the impact of the transition from Financial Reporting Standards to Malaysian Financial Reporting Standards (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½MFRSï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) and ensured the impact has been considered and adjusted retrospectively and all the current year transactions were accounted for in accordance with MFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls put in place by the Group in respect of revenue recognition for property development activities and performed procedures to evaluate the design and implementation and operating effectiveness of such controls. We assessed the reasonableness of management-prepared budgets for property development costs and challenged management assumptions used in the preparation of the respective budgets. We also performed a retrospective review to establish the reliability of management-prepared budgets and considered the implications of amptions used in the budgets.

For the financial year ended 31 December 2018, the Group recorded revenue of approximately RM74,118,000 mainly derived from its harvesting, sawmilling, kiln drying of timber and sales of logs and right to log, and glass manufacturing segments. We identified revenue as an area of audit focus because of the significance of the amount of the revenue to the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s financial statements at the reporting date. Further, we also assessed the risk of material misstatement in respect of revenue recognition to be higher as the key performance indicators for the key management personnel are measured based on the financial performance (where revenue is the key determinant of the overall financial performance) of the Group.

Bhd. (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Permintï¿½ï¿½ï¿½). In prior financial years, the Company recognised impairment loss in Permint of approximately RM32,143,000. MFRS 136 Impairment of Assets requires entities to assess at each reporting date whether there is any indication that an impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If there is any such indication, the entity has to recalculate the recoverable amount of the asset. Due to the commencement of a new production stream, the Company determined the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary so that reversal of impairman be quantified. The Company determined the recoverable amount using the value-in-use method. As a result of the assessment, the Company recorded a reversal of impairment of RM1,400,000 in the current financial year. We focused on this area because of the significance of the carrying amount of the investment in subsidiaries which represents 77% of the total assets of the Company at the reporting date.

Upon adoption of the MFRS Framework, the Group adopted the accounting standard MFRS 9 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Financial instrumentsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which requires the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s credit losses to be based on a new, forward looking, expected credit loss (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ECLï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) impairment model which takes into account reasonable and supportable forward-looking information rather than an incurred loss model. The Group has put in place controls over the estimation of ECL for these trade receivables. The estimation process involves the application of judgement and the use of subjective assumptions. ECL on hire purchase receivables and loan receivables is significant to our audit due to the significant management determined judgement and estimates used in the calculation of the ECL and the uncertainty inherent in the ermined judgement and estimates used in the calculation of the ECL are: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ criteria to determine for a significant increase in credit risk (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½SICRï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½); ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ techniques used in determining the probability of defaults (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½PDï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) and loss given default (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½LGDï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½); and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ forward looking assumptions. There is also an added layer of complexity in the judgement and estimates as the use of hindsight by management is not permitted, which can be difficult to apply in practice.

11850,INSAS BHD,2019,Valuation of receivables,"Due to the inherent subjectivity that is involved in making judgements in relation to credit risk exposures to determine the recoverability of trade receivables, recoverability of trade receivables is considered to be significant audit risk. The Group applies a simplified approach in calculating provision for expected credit losses (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ECLsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½). Therefore, the Group does not track changes in credit risk, but instead recognises a loss provision based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date. The Group considers among others, its historical credit loss experience, adjusted for forward-looking factors specific to the debtors and the economic environment. Our procedures included, amongst others:- l Evaluating and testing the controls relating to credit control and approval process; l Assessing the recoverability of overdue receivables by comparing managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s views of recoverability of overdue receivables to historical patterns of receipts, in conjunction with reviewing receipts subsequent to  end for its effect in reducing overdue receivables as at the financial year end; l Holding discussions with management personnel to challenge the managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s view on justification on the adequacy of allowance for doubtful debts; and l Assessing the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of credit risk.

The valuation model adopted by the Group considers the present value of the net cash flows expected to be generated from the sale of the planted forest. To arrive at the fair value less cost to sell of the planted forest, the management considered the sales prices, volume, costs, discount rate, the conversion factor used to convert hectares of land under afforestation to cubic metre of standing timber and the conditions of the planted forest by engaging a third party to perform aerial survey. The carrying amount of the planted forest is significant to the audit as it requires the exercise of significant judgment in the evaluation of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s process over the estimates made for valuation of the planted forest. As part of the audit, we have obtained an undershe methodology adopted by the management in estimating the fair value less cost to sell of the planted forest and assessed whether such methodology is consistent with those used in the industry and we have evaluated managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s assumptions on the sales prices, expected volumes of trees to be harvested, costs and the discount rate used.

The Company estimated the recoverable amount of the investments in subsidiaries based on estimated future cashflows and applied a discount rate to arrive at the recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying value of the subject investments, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated recoverable amount and the difference accounted for as an impairment loss.

This could lead to future trends in the market departing from known trends based on past experience. There is therefore a risk that the estimates of net realisable values exceed future selling prices, resulting in more losses when inventories are sold. The determination of the estimated net realisable value of these development properties, land held for property development and property development costs is critically dependent upon the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s expectations of future selling prices. Our procedures included: (a) Comparing the recent transacted prices of comparable completed properties, after taking into consideration of the discount given, or where applicable, for certain properties, reviewed valuation reports obtained by management to facilitate the assessment. We focused our evaluation on those completed properties that are slow moving; (b) Where applicable, assessed the objectivity, independence, reputation, experience and expertise of the independent valuers; (c) Reviewed the methodology adopted by the independent valuers in estimating the fair value of the completed properties and assessed whether such methodology is consistent with those used in the industry; (d) Evaluated the appropriateness of the data used by the independent valuers as input into their valuations; and (e) Physical sighting of completed properties on a sampling basis and assessed the related cost of maine to determine any potential write down due to physical obsolescence.

How the matter was addressed in our audit The Company has investments in subsidiaries amounting to RM67.1 million (representing 91% of the total assets of the Company) as at 30 April 2019. The Companyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s investments in its subsidiaries, Kein Hing Thai Nguyen (Vietnam) Co., Ltd (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½KHTVï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) of RM3.49 million and Sanko Kein Hing Sdn. Bhd. (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½SKHï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) of RM1.08 million and amounts owing from these subsidiaries of RM3.75 million and RM2.27 million, respectively were higher than the subsidiariesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ net assets, respectively. This provides an indication that the carrying amounts of the cost of investment and amount owing from these subsidiaries may be impaired. Accordingly, the Company estimated the recoverable amount of the cost of investment in KHTV and amount owing from KHTV using the fairalue represents an estimate of the amount receivable in the event the prepaid lease payments is sold on a willing buyer and a willing seller basis. The Company estimated the recoverable amount of the cost of investment in SKH and amount owing from SKH using value-in-use (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½VIUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½), which involves estimation of future cash flows. This estimation is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement on both future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the future cash flows. Our audit procedures, among others, included the following: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ We reassessed the Companyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s assessment on indicators of impairment in subsidiaries. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ For recoverable amount estimated using fair value less costs of disposal: - We compared the cost to the fair value of land and buildings determined by an external, independent and qualified valuer in Vietnam. - We assessed the quotation price obtained by the management against the market value of a comparable prepaid lease payments based on publiclyr recoverable amount estimated using value-in-use: - We compared the input used in the cash flow projection to the budget of SKH which was approved by the Board of Directors. We have also compared the previous cash flow projection to the actual results and inquire management on any significant variances. - We assessed the discount rate which reflects the specific risk relating to the investment in SKH based on publicly available information. - We performed a sensitivity analysis by stress-testing the discount rate and growth rate used in deriving the VIU to assess the potential impact of a reasonable possible change to any of these assumptions on the recoverable amount.

12838,KELINGTON GROUP BHD,2019,Revenue and cost recognition,"Construction contract accounting is inherently complex due to the contracting nature of the business, which involves significant judgements. This includes the determination of the total budgeted contract costs to complete the projects and the calculation of percentage of completion which affects the quantum of revenue and profit to be recognised. In estimating the revenue to be recognised, the management considers past experience and work done certified by customers and/or independent third parties, where applicable. In estimating the total budgeted contract costs to completion, the management considers the completeness and accuracy of its costs estimation, including its obligations to contract variations and claims. The total costs to completion are subject to a number of variables including the accuracy of designs, market conditions in respect of materials and sub-contractor cost and construction issues. An error in the estimated profit on contracts could result in a material variance in the amount of profit or loss recognised to date and therefore also in the current period. The profit recognition on contract includes key judgements over the expected recovery of costs arising from variations and claims and assessment on liquidated and ascertained damages costs, where applicable. In addition, changes in judgements, and the related estimates, as contracts progress, can result in material adjustments to margin, which can be both positive and negative. The potential outcome for contracts can have an individually and collectively material impact on the financial statements, whether through error or management bias. Our procedures included, amongst others:- ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Reviewed the contract value secured and projected budgeted costs; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed the estimated total costs to complete through enquiries with management; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Inspected documentation to support cost estimates made including contract variations and cost contingencies; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Compared contract budgets to actual outcomes to assess the reliabilirified actual progress billings issued and actual costs incurred for the financial year; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Checked subsequent billings of contract assets; and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Recomputed profit recognised and the percentage of",construction contract inherently complex contracting nature which involves can an judgements includes determination total budgeted costs cost complete projects calculation percentage completion affects quantum revenue profit be recognised estimating management considers past experience work or done certified customers independent third parties where applicable completeness accuracy its including obligations variations claims sub subject number variables designs respect material materials contractor issues error estimated contracts could result variance therefore recognition recovery arising liquidated ascertained damages addition changes estimates progress adjustments margin both positive negative potential outcome individually collectively impact through bias secured projected enquiries inspected documentation support contingencies compared budgets actual outcomes reliability verified billings issued incurred checked subsequent recomputed

The goodwill was impaired due to the slowdown in the construction and property development sector in Malaysia which has led to weak financial performance of the subject subsidiary. The annual impairment test for goodwill is significant to our audit as the assessment process is complex, highly judgmental and the quantum involved is material to the Group. The Group estimated the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½CGUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) to which the goodwill was allocated based on the value-in-use (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½VIUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½). Estimating the VIU of the CGU involved estimating the future cash inflows and outflows that will be generated by the CGU, and discounting it at an appropriate rate. Significant judgement was required in determin to estimate the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the above goodwill had been allocated to and was based on assumptions that are affected by expected future demand or economic conditions. The assumptions used included estimates of future sales volume, prices, operating costs and discount rate. Our audit procedures, among others, included assessing whether the assumptions on which the cash flow projections were based were consistent with past actual outcomes, in particular the assumptions about estimated revenue growth rates and possible variations in the timing of those future cash flows.

The Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s goodwill on consolidation and other intangible assets amounted to RM895,461,000 and RM456,049,000 respectively as at 31 December 2018. There is a risk that the carrying values of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable when comparing the carrying values with the recoverable amounts, which are determined based on fair value less costs of disposal and value in use calculations respectively for the Germany and Thailand units.

MFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers became effective on 1 January 2018, which requires the Group to change its accounting policies on revenue recognition. The accounting standard introduces elements of judgement to evaluate contracts with customers and the appropriate revenue recognition method. Judgement is particularly required to determine the number of performance obligations, method of allocating transaction price to each performance obligation, determination of whether revenue is to be recognised over time or at a point in time, and new disclosures to be made in the financial statements. The Group has construction contracts with targeted completion periods ranging from 12 to 36 months. In accordance with MFRS 15, construction contracts revenue is recognised over time based on output method, which is determined by reference to rformed or completion of a physical proportion of contract work. Judgement is required in the estimation of physical proportion of contract work completed. Where actual differs from the estimated physical work completion, such difference will also impact the contract costs and profits recognised. Due to the level of judgement involved, this is one of the key judgemental area that our audit is concentrated on. How the matter was addressed in our audit Our audit procedures included, among others, understanding the process activities undertaken by the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s in adopting MFRS 15, appropriateness of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s accounting policies on construction contracts revenue and implementation measures for the changes required by MFRS 15. We evaluated the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s transition approach and the practical expedients applied. We used a variety of quantitative and qualitative factors to select construction contracts with a higher risk of material error based on their size or complexity for testing. We read d minutes of meeting with customers, selected signed contracts and read key clauses to identify relevant contractual terms covering damages and variation orders and determined whether these were considered in accordance with the requirements of MFRS 15. This includes inspection of amount of revenue agreed in signed contracts and approved variation orders. In assessing reasonableness of construction contracts revenue, we evaluated reasonableness of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s output method, by obtaining documentations to support the stage of completion of physical contract work performed, and evaluated against the requirements of MFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. We also compared the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s stage of completion to our calculation if stage of completion was based on input method or actual contract costs incurred. We also visited sites for certain material projects and held discussion with site personnel to gauge reasonableness of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s estimation of stage of completion of physical comed. In assessing reasonableness of construction contracts profits, we evaluated the reasonableness of budgeted costs of each material project by comparing to similar completed projects, prior year budgets and actual overhead costs incurred in similar projects. In assessing recoverability of amount due from contract customers, for projects that appear to be behind schedule, we compared maximum damages exposure against provision made by the Group and inspected subsequent billings and payments. We also inspected minutes and correspondences with customers, and corroborated the findings by obtaining assessments from operational and technical management personnel to evaluate the reasonableness of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s assessment.

In accordance with MFRS 136: Impairment of Assets, the Group is required to perform annual impairment test of cash generating units (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½CGUsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) or groups of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated. The Group has allocated the goodwill to CGU or group of CGUs according to bulking and plantation business segment. The Group estimated the recoverable amounts of its CGUs or groups of CGUs to which the goodwill are allocated based value-in-use (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½VIUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) method. The recoverable amount based on VIU of CGUs or groups of CGUs involves estimating the future cash inflows and outflows that will be derived from the CGUs or groups of CGUs, and discounting them at appropriate rates. The amount and timing of cash flows in the projection are dependent on the key assumptions made, which in turn are affected by expected future market and economic conditions. The key assumptions made ill on consolidation is disclosed in Note 18(b) to the financial statements. Given the significant judgement involved in the estimation of the VIU and substantial audit effort required in the assessment of possible variations in the basis and assumptions used by the Group in deriving the recoverable amounts of the respective CGUs or groups of CGUs, we identified impairment of goodwill to be an area of audit focus. As part of our audit, we performed the following procedures: (a) Obtained understanding of the methodologies used by the Group in performing the impairment assessment; (b) Evaluated key assumptions used in the preparation of the cash flow forecasts against historical evidence, existing contracts, expectations on future contracts and revenue growth; (c) Evaluated the appropriateness of the discount rates used to determine the present value of the cash flows; and (d) Assessed the presentation and disclosures in the financial statements including significant accounting policies.",as at march amount goodwill will is by amounted approximately rm12 million accordance or mfrs 136 impairment required perform annual test cash generating units cgus cgu groups which has be been allocated according bulking plantation business segment estimated recoverable amounts are based value viu method involves estimating future inflows flows flow outflows derived discounting them appropriate rates timing projection dependent key assumptions made turn affected expected market economic conditions relation consolidation 18 financial statements given significant involved estimation substantial audit effort assessment possible variations used deriving respective we identified focus part methodologies performing evaluated preparation forecasts against evidence existing contracts expectations growth determine present presentation policies

In performing the impairment test of the operation, the Group determined the recoverable amount based on the value-in-use (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½VIUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) of the cash generating assets by discounting expected future cash flows generated from the concession right over the remaining concession period based on the managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s assessments of cash inflows from estimated future earnings and outflows of expected operating costs. We focused on this area as the impairment test involves significant management judgemeble amount which is highly sensitive to key assumptions applied in respect of future year revision in rental rates, outflow of expected operating costs, historical occupancy rate and the pre-tax discount rate used in the cash flow projections. A small change in the assumption can have a significant impact on the estimation of the recoverable amount. We assessed the cash flows projection which was approved by the Directors against recent performance and the mathematical accuracy of the projections; Compared the key assumptions including forecasted revision in rental rates, outflow of expected operating costs, historical occupancy rate and the pre-tax discount rate used against our knowledge of the hostel management divisionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s historical performance, business and cost management strategies based on facts and circumstances currently available; We reviewed the pre-tax discount rate used by comparison to third party information, the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s cost of capital and relevant risk factors; Performed sensisis by changing certain key assumptions used in the VIU calculations and assessed the impact of the recoverable amounts; and We have considered the adequacy of disclosures on the impairment assessments.",as shown 10 financial recorded concession right amount amounted rm16 930 823 we have performed evaluate management methodology assumptions assumption used viu result hostel division was favourable occupancy rate incremental inflation operating costs cost adversely affecting performance asset performing impairment test operation determined recoverable based cash generating by discount discounting expected future flows flow generated from remaining period assessments inflows estimated earnings outflow outflows involves significant can determining which highly sensitive key respect revision rental rates historical pre tax projections projection small change impact estimation assessed approved against recent mathematical compared forecasted knowledge strategies facts circumstances currently available reviewed comparison third party capital factors sensitivity changing certain calculations amounts considered

The associate has reported losses and depleting shareholders' funds indicating that the investment in associate with a carrying amount of RM90.5 million may be impaired. Where such indication exists, MFRS 136: Impairment of Assets (""MFRS 136"") requires an entity to estimate the recoverable amount of the asset. MFRS 136 defines recoverable amount as the higher of an asset's or cash generating unit (""CGU"")'s fair value less costs of disposal (""FVLCD"") and its value in use (""VIU""). VIU is the present value of future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or a CGU. The discount factor to be applied to the future cash flows should reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Accordingly, the Group has performed impairment assesment by comparing the carrying amount of the investment in an associate to its respective recoverable amounts. Given the significance of investment in an associate to the Group, the judgements and estimates involved in the assessment of the recoverable amount, we have identified the above impairment assessment as important to our audit. Our procedures in reviewing the impairment assessment based on VIU inter alia the following: - We have assessed the key assumptions on which the cash flow projections are based, amongst others and where relevant, by comparing them against historical trends, existing contracts, order book, useful lives of the assets and price forecasts. We also evaluated the probability of securing significant future contracts by making enquiries with the project teams and reviewing project proposals to obtain an understanding of the status of negotiations and the likelihood of securing the contracts; and We also assessed the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows and whether the rate used reflects the return that investors would require if they were to choose an investment that would generate cash flows of amounts, timing and risk profile equivalent to those that the entity expects to derive from the asset.

14328,CARLSBERG BREWERY MALAYSIA BHD,2019,KIV,"Under MFRS 15, consideration payable to a customer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue from contracts with customers. Consideration payable to a customer includes trade offers which consist primarily of trade discounts and volume rebates. Trade discounts and volume rebates accruals are based on agreed trading terms and promotional activities with trade customers and distributors. These accruals are calculated based on estimated sales volume to be achieved by each customer, multiplied with the contracted rate of each customer based on their respective trading agreements. The calculation of trade discounts and volume rebates accruals is complex as it involved the use of critical accounting estimates and assumptions made by management in determining the estimated sales volume. Management uses either the expected value method or the most likely amount method depending on which method better predicts the amount of consideration payable under the terms of the contracts. This is a significant area for our audit as it requires us to exercise judgement in evaluating managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s estimation of the amount of trade discounts and volume rebates required.

14364,CIMB GROUP HOLDINGS BHD,2019,KIV,"Refer to accounting policy I(i) and Notes 12, 42, 57(a) and 60 of the Financial Statements. We focused on this area due to the size of the carrying value of loans, advances and financing, which represented 63% of total assets of the Group. The Group adopted MFRS 9 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Financial Instrumentsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, with a date of transition of 1 January 2018. MFRS 9 introduces an expected credit loss (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ECLï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) impairment model, which requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour. This is a new and complex accounting standard which has required considerable judgement and interpretation in its implementation. The significant judgements in applying the accounting requirements for measuring ECL include the following: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Building the appropriate collective assessment models used to calculate ECL. The models are inherently complex and judgement is applied in determining the appropriate construct of the model; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Identithat have experienced a significant increase in credit risk; and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assumptions used in the ECL models such as expected future cash flows, forward-looking macroeconomic factors and data sets. We performed the following audit procedures: Individual assessment ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Understood and tested the relevant controls over identification of loans, advances and financing that have experienced significant increase in credit risk or objective evidence of impairment and the calculation of the impairment loss. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Examined a sample of loans, advances and financing and formed our own judgement as to whether there was a significant increase in credit risk or any objective evidence of impairment. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Where objective evidence of impairment was identified by the Group and impairment loss was individually calculated, we examined both the quantum and timing of future cash flows used by the Group in the impairment loss calculation, challenging the assumptions and comparing estimates to external evidence where of the discounted cash flows were also re-performed. Collective assessment ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed the methodologies inherent within the collective assessment ECL models applied against the requirements of MFRS 9; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Tested the design and operating effectiveness of the controls relating to: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Governance over ECL methodology and model development, including model build, model approval and model validation; and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Data used to determine the allowances for credit losses. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed and tested the significant modelling assumptions; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed and considered reasonableness of forward-looking forecasts assumptions; and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Checked the accuracy of data and calculation of the ECL amount, on a sample basis. We have checked the impact of adoption of MFRS 9 on date of transition and provided status updates to the Audit Committee during the financial year due to the complexity and size of the implementation. The assessment and conclusion on the more judgmental interpretations made bmittee. There were instances where proxies were applied to the ECL calculations. In these instances, the quantum of impairment required was different from that determined by management.

The Group recorded goodwill of RM7,680 million as at 31 December 2018 which arose from a number of acquisitions in prior years. For purposes of the annual impairment assessment of goodwill, the Group has assessed the recoverable amount of each cash generating unit (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½CGUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) with allocated goodwill based on the higher of the value-in-use (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½VIUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) and fair value less cost of disposal. The Group determined that the recoverable amount of all CGUs was based on VIU which involves estimation of future cash flows. This estimation is inherently uncertain and requires significant judgement on both future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the future cash flows. Therefore, the extent of judgement and the size of the goodwill resulted in this matter being identified as an area of audit focus. We performed the following audit procedures: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed that each CGU represents the smallest identenerate independent cash flows based on our understanding of the business model of the Group. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Compared the cash flow projection of each CGU to the approved budget for the respective CGU. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Compared previous cash flow projections to actual results of each CGU to assess the reasonableness of assumptions used in the cash flow projections. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Independently computed discount rates which reflect the specific risks relating to each CGU based on publicly available information. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed the reasonableness of the terminal growth rates based on historical results, economic outlook and industry forecasts. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Independently performed a sensitivity analysis over terminal growth rates and discount rates used in deriving the VIU to assess the potential impact of a reasonable possible change to any of these assumptions on the recoverable amount of each CGU.

We discussed with management on the basis used to write down certain models of motor vehicle inventory balance to their net realisable values as at the reporting date. We focused on the amount of write down of inventories recognised as an expense in the current financial year as it involved significant management judgement such as determining the timing of the launch of new models, the general economic conditions of the country and the consumer's demand. The determination of the estimated net realisable value of the motor vehicles inventory balance is also subject to high estimation uncertainty. Refer to Note H in the summary of significant accounting policies and Notes 3(a), 6 and 15 to the financial statements. For new motor vehicles, the basis used by management to determine the net realisable value was to consider the prevailing market conditions and expected promotional costs to be incurred in relation to the new vehicles to be sold in the following calendar year. We selected a number of new motor vehicle models that were written down to their net realisable values, and checked against the transacted prices after the reporting date, where available, or the estimated discounts expected to be given on these models based on certain factors determined by management. For used motor vehicles, management had determined the net realisable value based on information gathered from third party e-commerce websites that sell used cars and made certain adjustments, where necessary. We assessed the reasonableness of the net realisable values of certain models of the inventory balance by checking the net realisable value of these used cars to the prices of similar car models published on the third party e-commerce websites. We also selected a number of used motor vehicle models that were written down to their net realisable values, and checked against the transacted prices after the reporting date, where available, or estimated discounts expected to be given to the customers based on certain factors determined by management.

Investment properties carried at fair value as at 31 December 2018 amounted to RM311.5 million. The valuation of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s investment properties is inherently subjective due to, among other factors, the individual nature of each property, its location and the expected future rental income for that particular property. The existence of significant estimation uncertainty, coupled with the fact that only a small percentage difference in individual property valuation assumptions, when aggregated, could result in material misstatement, is why we have given specific audit focus and attention to this area. The valuations were carried out by independent professional valuers which were engaged by the Group. External valuations We read the valuation reports for all investment properties and discussed the reports with the valuers. We found that the valuation approach for each property was med in accordance with MFRS 13 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Fair value measurementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and suitable for use in determining the fair values of investment properties as at 31 December 2018. From our discussions with management and the valuers and our understanding of the valuation reports, we noted that the valuers have considered factors related to each propertyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s individual characteristics and its overall quality, geographic location and desirability as a whole in arriving at the fair value. There was no evidence of management bias or influence on the values in relation to these factors. We evaluated the valuersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ competency, capabilities, and objectivity by checking the valuerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s qualifications and registration to the Board of valuers, Appraisers, Estate Agents and Property Managers Malaysia website.

14488,MALAYAN BANKING BHD,2019,Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets,"(i) Goodwill The Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s goodwill balance as at 31 December 2018 stood at RM5.6 billion. Goodwill impairment testing of cash generating units (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½CGUsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) relies on estimates of value-in-use (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½VIUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) based on estimated future cash flows. The Group is required to annually test the amount of goodwill for impairment. (ii) Investment in subsidiaries and interest in associates As at 31 December 2018, the carrying amount of investment in subsidiaries (Bank only) stood at RM31.4 billion and interest in associates (Group and Bank) stood at RM2.3 billion and RM0.5 billion respectively. Similarly, we focused on impairment assessment of investment in subsidiaries and interest in associates as the impairment testing relies on VIU estimates based on estimated future cash flows. These involve management judgement and are based on complex assumptions that are affected by expected future market and economic conditions. Refer to summary of significant accounting policies in Notes 2.3(i), 2.3 accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in Notes 3.6 and 3.7 and the disclosure of (i) goodwill and (ii) investment in subsidiaries and interest in associates in Notes 21, 22 and 24 to the financial statements. Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the Group and the Bank in performing the impairment assessment. We tested the basis of preparing the cash flow forecasts taking into account the back testing results on the accuracy of previous forecasts and the historical evidence supporting underlying assumptions. We also assessed the appropriateness of the other key assumptions, such as the weighted average cost of capital discount rates assigned to the CGUs, as well as the long-term growth rate, by comparing against internal information, and external economic and market data. We also assessed the sensitivity analysis performed by management on the key inputs to the impairment models, to understand the impact that reasonable alternative assumptions would have on the overall carrying amounts. We also reviewed the adequacy of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s and the Bankï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s disclosures within the financial statements about those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive.

14524,MALAYAN BANKING BHD,2019,KIV,"As at 31 December 2018, the loans, advances and financing represent 63% and 50% of the total assets of the Group and of the Bank respectively, and the investments carried at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income represent 18% and 25% of the total assets of the Group and of the Bank respectively. The adoption of MFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Group's and the Bank's accounting for loans, advances and financing and investments' loss impairment by replacing MFRS 139's incurred loss approach with a forward-looking expected credit loss (""ECL"") approach. The measurement of ECL requires the application of significant judgement and increased complexity which include the identification of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet credit exposures with significant deterioration in credit quality, assumptions used in the ECL models (for exposures assessed individually or collectively) such as the expected future cash flows, forward-looking macroeconomic factors and probability-weighted multiple scenarios. Refer to summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2.3(v), significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions in Notes 3.2 and 3.4 and the disclosures of loans, advances and financing and investments in Notes 11, 13, 15, 48 and 49 to the financial statements. OUR PERFORMANCE PG. 02-08 THE FINANCIALS PG. 09-318 Our response Our audit procedures included the assessment of key controls over the origination, segmentation, ongoing internal credit quality assessments, recording and monitoring of the loans, advances and financing and investments. We also assessed the processes and effectiveness of key controls over the transfer criteria (for the three stages of credit exposures under MFRS 9 in accordance with credit quality), impairment measurement methodologies, governance for development, maintenance and validation of ECL models, inputs, basis and assumptions used by the Group and the Bank in staging the credit exposures and calculating the ECL. For staging and identification of credit exposures with significant deterioration in credit quality, we assessed and tested the reasonableness of the transfer criteria applied by the Group and the Bank for different types of credit exposures. We evaluated if the transfer criteria are consistent with the Group's and the Bank's credit risk management practices. For the measurement of ECL, we assessed and tested reasonableness of the Group's and the Bank's ECL models, including model input, model design and model performance for significant portfolios. We challenged whether historic experience is representative of current circumstances and of the recent losses incurred in the portfolios and assessed the reasonableness of forward-looking adjustments, macroeconomic factor analysis and probability-weighted multiple scenarios. We evaluated if changes in modeling approaches, parameters and assumptions are needed and if any changes made were appropriate. We also assessed, tested and monitored the sensitivity of the credit loss provisions to changes in modelling assumptions. With respect to individually assessed ECL which are mainly in relation to the impaired financial assets in Stage 3, we reviewed and tested a sample of loans, advances and financing and investments to evaluate the timely identification by the Group and the Bank of exposures with significant deterioration in credit quality or which have been impaired. For cases where impairment has been identified, we assessed the Group's and the Bank's assumptions on the expected future cash flows, including the value of realisable collaterals based on available market information and the multiple scenarios considered. We also challenged the assumptions and compared estimates to external evidence where available. We also assessed whether the financial statement disclosures are adequate and appropriately reflect the Group's and the Bank's exposures to credit risk. We involved our credit modelling specialists and IT specialists in the performance of these procedures where their specific expertise was required.

The carrying amount of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s net assets exceeds its market capitalisation, thereby indicating potential impairment of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s non-current assets. Accordingly, the Group estimated the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment and land use rights using the value- in-use method based on cash flow projections derived from budgets approved by management covering a five year period including terminal value. Estimating the value-in-use involves estimating the future cash inflows and outflows and discounting them at an appropriate discount rate. This impairment review was significant to our audit because the assessment process is complex and is based on assumptions that are highly judgmental. Oothers, evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the Group, in particular those relating to the discount rate and projected cash flows for the CGU. The areas that involved significant audit effort and judgment were the assessment of the probability of securing future revenue contracts, possible variations in the amount and timing of cash flows and the determination of an appropriate discount rate. Our procedures to assess managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s impairment testing included the following: (a) enquired with business development teams to obtain an understanding of the status of negotiations and the likelihood of securing the revenue contracts for contracts above our testing threshold, including timing of commencement and expected value of revenue contracts; (b) evaluated the reasonableness of the estimated profits to be derived from those revenue contracts above our testing threshold by comparing the estimated profits with the actual margins achieved by the Group in previous years; and (c) assessed the riateness of the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows and whether the rate used reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In addition, we also evaluated the adequacy of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s disclosures of each key assumption on which the Group has based its cash flow projections and to which the CGUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s recoverable amount is most sensitive, as disclosed in Note 12 to the financial statements.

The intangible assets relates to capitalised development costs work-in-progress and subject to annual impairment testing. An impairment assessment was performed by management on the small volume injectable plant because the plant has not been utilised at its maximum capacity as most of the products are still at development stage. Management assessed the impairment of intangible assets together with the PPE as one cash generating unit (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½CGUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½). The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on value-in-use calcquired as the recoverable amount of the CGU was in excess of the carrying amount of the assets within the CGU.

As at 31 December 2018, the carrying value of the cost of investment in the small volume injectable subsidiary is RM200.0 million. An impairment assessment was performed by management because the subsidiaryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s small volume injectable plant has not been utilised at its maximum capacity as most of the products are still at development stage. The recoverable amount of the investment is determined based on discounted future cash flows adjusted for tax and repayment of intercompany balances. No impairment was required as the recoverable amount was in excess of its carrying amount. We focused on this area as the recoverable amount of the investment is determined based on value-in-use method, which requires judgement on the part of management on the future financial performance of the subsidiary. Our procedures in relation to managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s impairment assessment includeing: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed the reliability of managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s forecast through the review of past trends of actual financial performances against previous forecasted results; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Checked the key assumptions used by management in the value-in-use calculations on sales volume growth rate and margins by product comparing to business plans, historical results and market data; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Checked that the outcome of the related sensitivity analysis based on range of possible changes determined by management is consistent with our independent expectations; and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.

Goodwill impairment testing of cash generating units (""CGUs"") relies on estimates of value-in-use (""VIU"") based on estimated future cash flows. The Group and the Bank are required to annually test the amount of goodwill for impairment. Similarly, we focused on impairment assessment of investment in subsidiaries as the impairment testing relies on VIU estimates based on estimated future cash flows. These involve management judgment and are based on assumptions that are affected by expected future market and economic conditions.

The adoption of MFRS 9 has fundamentally changed the Group's and the Bank's accounting for loan and financing loss impairment by replacing MFRS 139's incurred loss approach with a forward-looking expected credit loss (""ECL"") approach. Our response Our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions and methodologies used by the Group and the Bank in performing the impairment assessment. We tested the basis of preparing the cash flow forecasts taking into account the back testing results on the accuracy of previous forecasts and the historical evidence supporting underlying assumptions. We also assessed the appropriateness of the other key assumptions, such as the growth rates used to extrapolate the cash flows and the discount rates applied, by comparing against internal information, and external economic and market data. We also assessed the sensitivity analysis performed by management on the key inputs to the impairment models, to understand the impact that reasonable alternative assumptions would have on the overall carrying amounts. We also reviewed the adequacy of the Group's and the Bank's disclosures within the financial statements about those assumptions to which the outcome of the impairment test is most sensitive. Our audit procedures included the assessment of key controls over the origination, segmentation, ongoing internal credit quality assessments, recording and monitoring of loans, advances and financing and the investments. We also assessed the processes and effectiveness of key controls over the transfer criteria (for the three stages of credit exposures under MFRS 9 in accordance with credit quality), impairment measurement methodologies, governance for development, maintenance and validation of ECL models, inputs, basis and assumptions used by the Group and the Bank in staging the credit exposures and calculating the ECL. 2018 ANNUAL REPORT Risk area and rationale",at 2018 loans loan advances financing represent 75 74 total assets bank respectively investments carried amortised through other comprehensive income 16 15 adoption mfrs fundamentally changed account for loss impairment by replacing 139 incurred approach with forward looking credit ecl our procedures included evaluating assumptions methodologies used performing assessment we test basis preparing cash flow forecasts taking into back testing results previous supporting under also assessed key growth rates extrapolate internal external economic sensitivity inputs models understand impact reasonable alternative would over overall reviewed within about those outcome most sensitive controls origination segmentation ongoing quality assessments recording monitoring processes effectiveness transfer criteria three stages exposures measurement governance development maintenance validation staging calculating annual rationale
14704,PUBLIC BANK BHD,2019,KIV,"The measurement of ECL requires the application of significant judgment and increased complexity which include the identification of on-balance sheet and off- balance sheet credit exposures with significant deterioration in credit quality, assumptions used in the ECL models (for exposures assessed individually or collectively) such as the expected future cash flows, forward looking macroeconomic factors and probability-weighted multiple scenarios. Refer to summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2(iv)(h)(i), significant accounting judgment, estimates and assumptions in Note 2(iv)(a)(ii) and the disclosures of loans, advances and financing and investments in Note 12, 8 and 10 to the financial statements. Our response For staging and identification of credit exposures with significant deterioration in credit quality, we assessed and tested the reasonableness of the transfer criteria applied by the Group and the Bank for different types of credit exposures. We evaluated if the transfer criteria are consistent with the Group's and the Bank's credit risk management practices. For the measurement of ECL, we assessed and tested reasonableness of the Group's and the Bank's ECL models, including model input, model design, model performance for significant portfolios. We challenged whether historic experience is representative of current circumstances and of the recent losses incurred in the portfolios and assessed the reasonableness of forward looking adjustments, macroeconomic factor analysis and probability-weighted multiple scenarios. We evaluated if changes in modelling approaches, parameters and assumptions are needed and if any changes made were appropriate. We also assessed and tested and monitored the sensitivity of the credit loss provisions to changes in modelling assumptions. With respect to individually assessed ECL which are mainly in relation to the impaired assets in Stage 3, we reviewed and tested a sample of loans, advances and financing and investments to evaluate the timely identification by the Group and the Bank of exposures with significant deterioration in credit quality or which have been impaired. For cases where impairment has been identified, we assessed the Group's and the Bank's assumptions on the expected future cash flows, including the value of realisable collaterals based on available market information and the multiple scenarios considered. We also challenged the assumptions and compared estimates to external evidence where available. We also assessed whether the financial statement disclosures appropriately reflect the Group's and the Bank's exposure to credit risk.

Bhd. (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½RanhillPower IIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½). The investment allowance was approved and granted by the Ministry of Finance (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½MoFï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) to RanhillPower II in a letter dated 4 November 2010 and is available to be carried forward until it is utilised in full. Accordingly, the deferred tax asset has been recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which such unutilised investment allowance can be utilised. In assessing this, RanhillPower II considered its projected taxable profits up to the end of the concession period in year 2032 under the Power Purchase Agreeerein. During the year, the new Finance Act 2018 which came into effect on 27 December 2018, introduced a 7-Year Limitation on carry forward of unabsorbed business losses, unutilised reinvestment and investment allowances. Such ruling implies that RanhillPower II can only utilise its unutilised investment allowance against any taxable profit up to year 2026, requiring a potential reversal of deferred tax asset to the income statement of RM57,702,000. RanhillPower II, through its tax consultant, has since appealed to the Ministry of Finance (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½MoFï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) to allow RanhillPower II to utilise the investment allowance up to the end of the concession period in year 2032.

Management, after consultation with its tax consultants and solicitors, is of the opinion that it is likely that the appeal will be successful and determines its tax position on that basis. Accordingly, they continue to recognise the deferred tax asset relating to unutilised investment allowance on the basis that any unutilised investment allowance will be available up to year 2032. The outcome of the appeal can only be confirmed by uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group and may develop in ways not initially expected. Therefore, the Group continually assesses the development of this appeal to determine its tax position. Such assessment involves significant judgment and estimates which are highly subjective. Accordingly, we consider this to be an area of audit focus.

Such judgement involves estimation uncertainty which have significant risk of causing material misstatements to the amounts recognised in the financial statements.

We identified revenue recognition to be an area of audit focus as the magnitude and the high volume of transactions may give rise to a higher risk of material misstatements relating to the timing and amount of revenue recognised. Specifically, we focused our audit efforts to determine the possibility of overstatement of revenue. Revenue is recognised net of customer rebates. Customer rebates are recognised based on the expected entitlement earned up to the reporting date under each customer trading agreement and promotions run. Certain customer rebates are triggered when certain conditions are met. The amount payable is based on the conditions achieved, multiplied by rates contracted with each customer in their trading agreements. As such, we also assessed the risk of material misstatement in respect of managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s estimates of customersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ re as it is an area which may give rise to possible overstatement of revenue. Report on the financial statements (Contï¿½ï¿½ï¿½d) As part of our audit, we performed the following: (a) obtained an understanding of the Groupï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s relevant internal controls and tested the controls over timing and amount of revenue recognised; (b) inspected the terms of sales invoices to determine the point of transfer of control to customers; (c) inspected documents evidencing the delivery of goods to customers; (d) tested the recording of sales transactions close to the year end, including credit notes issued after year end, to establish whether the transactions were recorded in the correct accounting period; and (e) in respect of managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s estimates of customersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ rebates, our audit procedures included amongst others, evaluating the relevant controls performed by management in estimating the amount and timing of recognition of customersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ rebates.

According to MFRS 102 Inventories and the Group's accounting policy, inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories may not be recoverable, if those inventories are damaged, if they have become wholly or partially obsolete, or if their selling prices have declined. The cost of inventories may also not be recoverable, if the estimated costs of completion or the estimated costs to be incurred to make the sale have increased. At the end of the financial year, management applied judgement in estimating the net realisable value of the inventories. Estimates of net realisable value were based on the most reliable evidence available at the time the estimates were made, of the amount the inventories were expected to realise. These estimates took into consideration fluctuations of price or cost directly relating to events occurred after the end of the financial year to the extent that such events confirmed conditions existing at the end of the financial year.

Estimating the VIU involves estimating the future cash inflows and outflows that will be derived from the subsidiary, including key assumptions such as revenue growth rate and operating costs, and discounting them at an appropriate rate. Due to the significance of the carrying amount of investment in the subsidiary of RM624.99 million and the subjective estimates involved in the impairment assessment, we identified this as an area of audit focus. Our procedures in assessing impant in a subsidiary comprise the following: - We involved the component auditors in our evaluation of the assessment of recoverable amount of the impairment in subsidiary. We evaluated the managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s assumption on the revenue growth rate and operating costs by comparing to industry knowledge and historical data. - We also assessed whether the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows reflects the return that investors would require if they were to choose an investment that would generate cash flows of amounts, timing and risk profile equivalent to those that the entity expects to derive. The notes relating to impairment in a subsidiary are disclosed in Note 2.17, Note 3(a) and Note 14(e) to the financial statements.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditorsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditorsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. - Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. - Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of  activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

MFRS 9 introduces an expected credit losses (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ECLï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) impairment model for financial assets measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income. The measurement of ECL requires the use of complex models and significant assumptions about future economic conditions and credit behaviour. We focused on the ECL for loans, advances and financing due to the significance of impairment allowance on loans, advances and financing assets balance. The Directors also exercised significant judgement on the following areas: Timing of identification of Stage 2 and Stage 3 loans, advances and financing ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessment of objective evidence of impairment of loans, advances and financing based on mandatory and judgemental triggers ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Identification of loans, advances and financing that have experienced a significant increase in credit risk Individual as and timing of futures cash flows based on realisation of collateral or borrowersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ business cash flows Collective assessment ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Choosing the appropriate collective assessment models and assumptions for the measurement of ECL such as expected future cash flows and forward ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ looking macroeconomic factors as disclosed in Note 46 Financial Risk Management ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ credit quality of financial assets Based on the tests of control performed, we did not identify any material exceptions. Our detailed testing over the loans, advances and financing were as below: Individual assessment We performed individual credit assessment on a sample of loans, advances and financing on those identified as Early Alert, Rescheduled and Restructured, Stages 2 and 3 loans accounts and formed our own judgement on whether the occurrence of loss event or significant increase in credit risk had been identified. We found no material exceptions in these tests. Where individual impairment had been identified for loans, we assessed the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions of the cash flows forecasts prepared by management. For cash flows forecasts based on realisation of collateral, we agreed the collateral valuation to the current valuation report prepared by independent valuers. If current valuation report is not available, we compared the value used by management against the independent third party publicly available report on property market based on similar property type, location and size. For cash flow forecasts based on borrowerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s business cash flows, we assessed the reasonableness of the underlying key assumptions used by management and performed sensitivity analysis. Collective assessment Where ECL was calculated on a collective basis, our testing, on a sample basis, included the following: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed the methodologies inherent within the collective assessment ECL models applied against the requirements of MFRS 9 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ We re-performed the bucketing of loans into delinquency buckets (loantion) and re-computed the Probability of Default ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ We agreed the loans recoveries data for Loss Given Default to supporting evidence ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Assessed and considered the reasonableness of forward-looking forecasts assumptions ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ We re-performed the calculation of ECL and agreed the results to the general ledger.

15854,AFFIN BANK BHD,2019,Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets,"(Refer to Summary of Significant Accounting Policy Notes D, Note AF and Note 21 to the financial statement). Goodwill amounting to RM826,944,000 arose from previous acquisitions and is allocated to Commercial Banking, Investment Banking, Stock-broking, Asset Management and Money-broking cash generating units (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½CGUsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½). The Bank determines the recoverable amount of the CGUs based on the value-in-use calculations. We focused on this area due to the slowing down in loan growth and capital market activities of the Group. Given the materiality of the goodwill and sensitivity of the recoverable amount of Investment Banking and Stock-broking CGUs, impairment of goodwill could have significant impact on the financial statements. We also focused on this area due to the significant judgements made by the Directors over underlying assumptions in the impairment tests. Based on the impairment assessment prepared by management, the Investment Banking and Stock-broking CGUs were sensitive to changes in the di and terminal growth rates as disclosed in Note 21 Intangible Assets. We satisfied ourselves with the procedures performed below on the managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s assumptions used in the impairment model. We have compared cash flow projections to the budgets, which were approved by the respective subsidiariesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Board of Directors. We also held discussions with management to understand the basis for the assumptions used and compared the budgets against the actual results from prior years to assess the reliability of budgeting. We tested the assumptions used by management, in relation to the discounts rates, compounded annual and terminal growth rates for all CGUs. The discount rates used were based on the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital plus an appropriate risk premium, at the date of assessment of all the CGUs. We have assessed the reasonableness of the discount rates by independently re-calculating the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital based on data of comparable entities obtained from indepes for each CGUs. The terminal growth rates were based on the forecasted Gross Domestic Product (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½GDPï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) growth rate of Malaysia. We have compared the terminal growth rates used by management with the forecasted GDP growth rates independently obtained and assessed the reasonableness of the adjustments made to reflect the specific risk of the CGUs.

15910,BINA DARULAMAN BHD,2019,Revenue Recognition,"Refer to the Notes 17 and 18 to the financial statements. How the matter was addressed in our audit The Group recognises revenue and cost of units sold relating to properties under construction based on the stage of completion. The stage of completion of the said properties is determined by the proportion that the actual property development costs incurred for work performed to date to the estimated total property development costs.

Given the significance of concession assets to the Group and the judgement and estimates involved in the assessment of the recoverable amount, we identified the impairment of concession intangible assets for SIPSB as an important area of our audit. The Group estimated the recoverable amount of its cash generating units (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½CGUsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½) based on value- in-use (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½VIUï¿½ï¿½ï¿½). Estimating the VIU involves estimating the future cash inflows and outflows that will be derived from the intangible assets of SIPSB, and discounting them at an appropriate rate. The areas that involved significant audit effort and judgement were the assessment of possible variations in the amount and timing of cash flows and the determination of an appropriate. Based on the aforementioned impairment assessment, the Group has not recognised any impairment on the concession intangible assets of SIPSB for the year ended 31 December 2018. As at 31 December 2018, the carrying amount of the concession intangible assets of SIPSB is RM1,307mil. We have assessed and tested the key assumptions used by management to estimate the projected cash flows for the CGUs as follows: (a) checked the cargo projections provided by port users that have set up their operations at Samalaju; (b) checked the tariff rates used against the published rates issued by Samalaju Port Authority; (c) reviewed annual escalation of expenses against Malaysiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s inflation rate; (d) evaluated the discount rate used to determine the present value of the cash flows and whether the rate used reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset; and (e) assessed the sensitivity of the cash flows to changes in the discount rate and cargo projected.

We focused on the recoverability of the carrying amount of inventories (completed development units) because the estimates made by management in valuing the net realisable values of long outstanding unsold completed development units involved significant judgement.

Our response We obtained an understanding of management's process for assessing impairment of vessels. In respect of the value in use cash flows, we have performed the following procedures: We evaluated and assessed the appropriateness of the methodology and approach applied, including industry benchmarking. We evaluated the key assumptions used particularly the short-term and the long-term charter rates applied in the cash flows by comparing to industry data. We involved internal valuation specialists in the assessment of the appropriateness of the discount rate.

As disclosed in Note 3 (h) and Note 5 to the financial statements, the Group assesses at each financial year end whether there is an indication that an asset maybe impaired. If any such indication exists, or when an annual impairment assessment for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assetï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s recoverable amount. Plantation assets comprise land, bearer plants and biological assets are carried at fair value which require significant judgement, as such there was a risk that carrying value of the plantation assets may be stated at higher than recoverable amount. Therefore, an impairment assessment was required to determine whether there was impairment loss to be recognised during the year.

Economic and operating assumptions suctality, morbidity and surrender rates are the key inputs used in the estimation of these actuarial liabilities. Provision for outstanding claims and provision for unearned contribution ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Family and general takaful contract liabilities The provision for outstanding claims for the Group and the Company comprises the estimated cost of settling all claims incurred but unpaid at the year end, whether reported or not. The estimation of outstanding claims with respect to unreported claims requires significant judgment, as it involves the projection of the ultimate cost of all claims incurred but not settled at the end of the reporting period, together with the related claims handling costs. Judgment is required to assess the extent to which past claims trends may not represent the current situation and its impact on the assumptions over claims projection. Estimation of provision for unearned contribution involves judgement in the identification of best estimate value of Unexpired Risk Reserve at the requiredmargin for adverse deviation.

Estimating VIU involves the discounting of the estimated future cash inflows and outflows expected to be derived from the CGUs using appropriate discount rates to their present values. This was our area of focus as the impairment assessment was complex and highly judgemental.
